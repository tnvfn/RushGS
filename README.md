## Important to know.

RushGS is based on Project Reboot 3.0 and all main credits go to Milxnor. This is my first Open Source big OGFN gameserver.

All of these features are tested with Reload backend, so some features need some reload backend files. I don't provide my API's i use for testing, so those u need to make yourself.

## IF YOU ARE USING THIS PLEASE CREDIT ME (tnv) and ofc our friend Milxnor!
